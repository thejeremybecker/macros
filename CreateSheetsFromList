Sub CreateSheetsFromAList()
' Makes individual sheets based on a source table with cell references back to source table
' Quick and easy way to make test scripts
' Only loops through visible rows (hidden rows do not get tabs created)

' Confirm variables 1 - 5 below first
' Be sure 'Master (2)' sheet does not exist.
' Reset VBA project first to clear any variables (Reset/stop button in VBA editor)'
