'of the cell above each from within the selection range. You don't need a macro.

'F5 Special
'go to blanks in the formula bar add =A1 then press Ctrl + Enter

'Explanation--
'if a macro is needed: You can choose any selection area including multiple columns.
'When you pick out the blanks with Special cells the active cell will be the first blank cell
'and you use the cell above it in the formula.Special Cells restricts itself to the Used Area 
'so you can select multiple columns if you like and not be concerned that the entire column is
'mostly unused.
